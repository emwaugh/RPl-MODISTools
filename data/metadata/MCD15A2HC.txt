MODIS Combined (Terra + Aqua) 8-day composite L4 500m FPAR,LAI (MCD_PR15A2)

Document Revision: 10.11.2013

PGE Version  : 6.0.5
PGE Release  : 06.09.2014 _SS_


Product ID(s): MCD15A2H MODIS Terra + Aqua Gridded 500m FPAR and LAI (8-day composite)

Description:

   MODIS Level-4 500m Combined Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation
   (FPAR), and Leaf Area Index (LAI).  This 8-day combined algorithm
   produces a single FPAR,LAI tile product from at least one candidate daily
   MOD15A1 and one MYD15A1 FPAR,LAI products produced by PGE33.
   These are tiled using Sinuoidal grid.

   All FPAR and LAI data is stored in HDFEOS v.2.1.x files, as separate
   grid fields within the MOD_Grid_MCD15A2H grid object.  Note that the LAI
   product range of {0..100} should be interpreted biophysically as
   ranging from {0...10.0}, with one digit of implied precision.
   The HDFEOS file format produced by PGE 34 is the final 8-day
   FPAR, LAI composite product archived at EDC.

Significant changes:
   -- In collection 6 the input was changed to MOD15A1H/MYD15A1H, 500m daily LAI/FPAR and the output is
        500m 8 day LAI/FAR composites.

   -- In version 5.0.0 all metadata issues were fixed as reported by LDOPE. All lookup tables were updated.
      Weights have been introduced when calculating average LAI over distribution of solutions.
      Additionally two new SDSs to the product:
          FparStdDev_500m and LaiStdDev_500m
      They track the FPAR and LAI standard deviation for pixels produced
      by the main (R-T) method.
   -- There is a new FparLai_QC bit layout based on the changes recommended by LDOPE:

         BITFIELDS
       -------------
        0,0  MODLAND_QC bits
             '0' =  Good Quality (main algorithm with or without saturation)
             '1' =  Other Quality (back-up algorithm or fill values)

        1,1 SENSOR
             '0' = Terra
             '1' = Aqua

        2,2  DEADDETECTOR
             '0' = Detectors apparently fine for up to 50% of channels 1,2
             '1' = Dead detectors caused >50% adjacent detector retrieval

        3,4  CLOUDSTATE (this inherited from Aggregate_QC bits {0,1} cloud state)
             '00' = 0 Significant clouds NOT present (clear)
             '01' = 1 Significant clouds WERE present
             '10' = 2 Mixed cloud present on pixel
             '11' = 3 Cloud state not defined,assumed clear

        5,7  SCF_QC (3-bit, (range '000'..100') 5 level Confidence Quality score.
             '000' = 0, Main (RT) method used, best result possible (no saturation)
             '001' = 1, Main (RT) method used with saturation. Good,very usable
             '010' = 2, Main (RT) method failed due to bad geometry, empirical algorithm used
             '011' = 3, Main (RT) method failed due to problems other than geometry, empirical algorithm used
             '100' = 4, Pixel not produced at all, value coudn't be retrieved (possible reasons: bad L1B data, unusable MOD09GA data)
Versioning:

   We currently version-stamp our source code, ancillary files and product files
   with an identical version and release-timedate stamp, called UM_VERSION.
   Users may extract this version stamp from any product or ancillary file
   using a command like this:

               ncdump -h MOD15A2_ANC_RI4.HDF | grep UM_VERSION.

   The latest certified codeset carries this version stamp as a global file
   attribute in the product files, ancillary files, and within the executable:
   UM_VERSION =
    UM_VERSION = "U.MONTANA MODIS PGE34 Vers 5.0.4 Rev 4 Release 10.18.2006 23:59"

ECS Metadata Strings:

   Notes:
      1. "FR" is an abbreviation for "FREE_RANGE".
      2. "D/T" is an abbreviation for "DATE/TIME"
      3. (A) means that multiple values are stored within a single array.
      4. A value of "Variable" indicates that this value will vary
         according to the granule being processed.
      5. "M" means class M.
      6. (C) means that multiple values are stored as class members.

  BITS BITFIELD
  -------------
  0,0  MODLAND_QC bits
       '0' =  Good Quality (main algorithm with or without saturation)
       '1' =  Other Quality (back-up algorithm or fill values)

  1,1 SENSOR
       '0' = Terra
       '1' = Aqua

  2,2  DEADDETECTOR
       '0' = Detectors apparently fine for up to 50% of channels 1,2
       '1' = Dead detectors caused >50% adjacent detector retrieval

  3,4  CLOUDSTATE (this inherited from Aggregate_QC bits {0,1} cloud state)
       '00' = 0 Significant clouds NOT present (clear)
       '01' = 1 Significant clouds WERE present
       '10' = 2 Mixed cloud present on pixel
       '11' = 3 Cloud state not defined,assumed clear

  5,7  SCF_QC (3-bit, (range '000'..100') 5 level Confidence Quality score.
       '000' = 0, Main (RT) method used, best result possible (no saturation)
       '001' = 1, Main (RT) method used with saturation. Good,very usable
       '010' = 2, Main (RT) method failed due to bad geometry, empirical algorithm used
       '011' = 3, Main (RT) method failed due to problems other than geometry, empirical algorithm used
       '100' = 4, Pixel not produced at all, value coudn't be retrieved (possible reasons: bad L1B data, unusable MOD09GA data)

PGE34 Product File Global File Attributes (NOT searchable metadata)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Attribute Name:		UM_VERSION

Description:		Contains current version of the source code, ancillary files
			and product files. This is done to help assure that the executable
                        is run with a compatible ancillary file, and to provide a single
                        comprehensive versioning stamp common to our executables, product
                        files and ancillary files.


Attribute Name:		ENGINEERING_DATA

Description:		This text attribute contains a development log of various internal
                        session metrics.  The attribute "ENGINEERING_DATA" is created for
                        all runs, but is only populated if the LCMP_PCF_ENGDATA runtime switch
                        is set to "1" in the PCF file. If the LCMP_PCF_ENGDATA switch is set to
                        "0", the contents of the attribute is "(none-available)".
                        It's purpose is to more effectively enable post-processing
                        quality control at the SCF, when there is access to just the HDFEOS product
                        files and not the original ECS session logs.



=========================================================================================
NEW PGE34 OPTIONAL BROWSE FILE GENERATION
=========================================================================================

--Note that PGE34 now optionally produces a 5km BROWSE (or COARSE) product for each data layer,
  triggered by the .pcf file runtime input, LCMP_PCF_BROWSE, as a stand alone
  HDFEOS file. The adjusted gridfield names are each 240x240 pixels and are named:
    Fpar_5km,
    Lai_5km,
    FparLai_5kmQC,
    FparExtra_5kmQC


--The BROWSE generation feature is intended for use in MODAPS, and is NOT intended for
  routine use within the ECS Production System, as the HDF product files generated
  are currently not registered ESDTs.

--The separate BROWSE COARSE product file, when produced,  itis named after the PGE34 OUTPUT PRODUCT
  file as shown below:
   PRODUCT FILE : MCD15A2H.A2000265.h18v04.005.2000288143421.hdf
   BROWSE  FILE : MCD15A2HC.A2000265.h18v04.005.2000288143421.hdf

--The default BROWSE PCF runtime input for ECS, to suppress BROWSE generation, is:
  215050|LCMP_PCF_BROWSE|0

--If for a given tile, the .PCF file contains a runtime input LCMP_PCF_BROWSE that is
  set to a syntactically valid specification string, PGE34 will optionally produce
  a separate HDFEOS file containing (4) gridfields, one per standard SDS.

--The valid BROWSE specification string is a comma-delimited list of (3) arguments,
  with the following:

  LCMP_PCF_BROWSE|[{ew_stride},{ns_stride},{HDFEOS|HDF}
   where:
    ew_stride --the systematic skip-factor along the East-West axis
    ns_stride --the systematic skip-factor along the North-South axis
    fileType  --HDFEOS indicates a HDFEOS file should be made, or HDF for simple HDF.
